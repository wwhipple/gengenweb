gengenweb
---------
gengenweb began as a hack in 1994 at the birth of the Whipple Website (whipple.org). Since its origins, hard-coded hacks have been cobbled on as needed.

This github project is a response to two kinds of stimuli:

* Periodic requests for the author to share the code
* A Hack-a-thon by the author's employer.

During the hack-a-thon several hard-codings have been eliminated.

Possible future enhancements:

* Remove more hard codings
* Remove dependencies
* Improve documentation
* Add tests

Current external dependencies:
* Eugene W. Stark's ged2html (converts GEDCOM file to static web pages): http://www.starkeffect.com/ged2html/
* swish-e indexer: http://swish-e.org/
